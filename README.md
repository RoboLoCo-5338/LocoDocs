# LoCo Docs
This is the source code for FRC 5338's Wiki.js documentation system.

The installation itself is vanilla, the only custom features are a python script which runs via a CRON job at midnight every day, in order to dynamically generate certain aspects of the docs, and to ping/email people.

This entire system is self-hosted.
